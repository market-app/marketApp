# Market App

Market App is a useful tool that can simplify meal planning by providing a comprehensive grocery list based on the user's input of meals. The app will have an easy-to-use interface that enables users to add and remove items from their list. The grocery list will be customized to include all the necessary ingredients for the selected meals, with details on the type and quantity of each ingredient.

Moreover, Market App will have a feature that allows users to scan barcodes and directly add the items to their list. This will provide users with important information such as the price, expiration date, and calorie count of each item. In addition, the app will alert users if any item on their list is out of stock or if a new item has been added.

Furthermore, Market App will have a recipe database with various dishes from different cuisines, along with step-by-step instructions on how to prepare each meal. This will offer users additional ideas for meal planning and preparation.
